This is the companion app of the Flutter Firebase Compendium with code examples.

The Flutter Firebase Compendium is an article series published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@xeladu/list/the-flutter-firebase-compendium-2ec07e25baba) and as an e-book (coming soon). It explains how to use Firebase services from a Flutter application.

## How to run the code

The code uses Firebase as a backend but the Firebase configuration is not included. You have to add it yourself because there are paid features that might cause costs. Refer to [this article](https://medium.com/gitconnected/how-to-create-a-firebase-project-and-link-it-with-your-flutter-app-acd826be8356) above on how to perform the necessary steps in detail.

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
3. Install [FlutterFire CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterfire_cli)
4. Check out the code
5. Execute `firebase login` from the app root folder and log into your created Firebase project
6. Execute `flutterfire configure` from the app root folder and use your created Firebase project
7. A file `firebase_options.dart` will be created in your `lib` folder
8. Run the app
